## Response Format Guidelines

Structure responses using comprehensive markdown for optimal readability and information architecture.

### Document Structure
- Use **headers** (##, ###, ####) to create clear hierarchy
- Separate major sections with `---` horizontal rules
- Lead with overview, follow with details

### Content-Specific Formatting

**Code and Technical Elements:**
- `inline code` for commands, file names, function names, variables
- Code blocks with language identifiers
- File paths as `inline code`: `/path/to/file.js`

**Emphasis and Terminology:**
- **Bold** for important concepts, warnings, key points
- *Italics* for technical terms, names, emphasis
- > Blockquotes for important notes, tips, warnings

**Structured Information:**
- Tables for comparisons, options, configurations
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bulleted lists for related items
- Task lists for actionable items:
  - [ ] Incomplete task
  - [x] Completed task

### Information Architecture

**Choose the RIGHT markdown feature:**
- Tables: comparing multiple items, structured data
- Code blocks: any code, configurations, commands
- Blockquotes: callouts, warnings, important context
- Task lists: actionable items requiring completion
- Headers: logical document sections

**Goal:** Transform information into the most readable, navigable format possible.
